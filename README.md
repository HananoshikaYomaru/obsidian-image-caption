demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dee_OzcibLI>

> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin only works with external images. I don't use local image so I have no intention to support. But I am open to PR.

## Usage

```md
%% caption ![alt](src) %%

%% lightbox ![alt](src) %%

%% lightbox-{group} ![alt](src) %%
```

then it will generate `<figure>` element with a `<figcaption>` element inside on command `generate image caption on current file`.

> [!TIP]
> You will want to use this with custom save plugin to generate image caption on save.

## How it works?

The plugin will recognise the syntax and then check if there is a figure element below it. If not, it will generate one. If yes, the figure element will be replaced by generated result.
