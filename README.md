# Obsidian Markdown Image Caption

Generate image caption easily. Completely markdown-based.

demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dee_OzcibLI

## Usage

```md
%% caption ![alt](src)%%
```

then it will generate `<figure>` element on save.

## How it works? 

The plugin will recognise the syntax and then check if there is a figure element below it. If not, it will generate one. If yes, the figure element will be replaced by generated result.
